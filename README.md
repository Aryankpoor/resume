# SecondHand
Secondhand is a full stack ecommerce website boilerplate. It uses **MERN** stack.

## Technologies Used

### FRONT-END
    1. React
    2. For Form I have used a couple websites to receive responses such as formbackend and
    3. React Modules including React-Router-dom and React-hot-toast

### BACK-END
    1. React Modules such as cursers , multer
    2. MongoDB

### APP INFORMATION

1. Google Cloud Console is used for clientId and clientSecret allowing customers to login to the website using google. Their name and email Id is stored in the database
2. Again MongoDB stores all other information about their account

### APP FUNCTIONALITY
The app is fully functioning ranging from editing and deleting items from cart, adding multiple items to cart at once, real-time updating and multi page functionality.
The app also has an order tracking page, the only thing it is missing is the payment page due to the app not being a real-ecommerce website.

Note: The app has not been hosted yet on a domain but that will be updated in the future.
