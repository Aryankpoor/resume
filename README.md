# SecondHand

A digital library for books where users can borrow and return ebooks, like a real library! 

#### Yes! That does mean you will be fined for late returns

Currently in the process of obtaining permissions to lend out certain ebooks
Have only got the right for "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig for now :)


## How it works?
Well, as I said, it works like a real library. You can borrow books without having to pay for them. But that means you have to return them on time too! Late returns will be fined :)

You can also setup automatic return if you feel you might forget to return the book. That way, when the due date arrives, the book is automatically marked as ```available?:Yes``` and is free for other users to borrow!
